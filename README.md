# Fifty Things you can do with a Software Defined Radio

An [article](https://blinry.org/50-things-with-sdr/) written by @blinry
explores 50 things you might attempt using a Software Defined Radio or SDR.

This project attempts to create GNU Radio flowgraphs for each of those 
items. The aim is to create hardware independent and standalone flowgraphs.

Feel free to contribute your flowgraph(s), bug-fixes and documentation
updates.
